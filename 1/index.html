                    <h2>Discovery</h2>
                    <p>Human coronaviruses were first discovered in the late 1960s. 
                        The earliest ones discovered were an infectious bronchitis virus
                         in chickens and two in human patients with the common cold 
                         (later named human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43).
                         Other members of this family have since been identified, 
                         including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2004, HKU1 in 2005, 
                         MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 (formerly known as 2019-nCoV) in 2019. 
                         Most of these have involved serious respiratory tract infections.</p>

                    <h2>Morphology</h2>
                    <p>Coronaviruses are large pleomorphic spherical particles with bulbous 
                        surface projections. The diameter of the virus particles is around 120 nm.
                         The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a 
                         distinct pair of electron dense shells.</p>
                    <p>The viral envelope consists of a lipid bilayer where the membrane (M), 
                        envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.
                         A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus
                          subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called 
                          hemagglutinin esterase (HE).</p>

                <div class="col col-1 col-bg">
                    <p>Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 
                        30% of those infected (such as MERS-CoV), and some are relatively harmless, 
                        such as the common cold. Coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms, 
                        such as fever, and sore throat from swollen adenoids, occurring primarily in 
                        the winter and early spring seasons. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia 
                        (either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis 
                        (either direct viral bronchitis or a secondary bacterial bronchitis). 
                        The much publicized human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes 
                        severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it 
                        causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.</p>

                    <h2>Genomic cis-acting elements</h2>
                    <p>In common with the genomes of all other RNA viruses, coronavirus genomes contain 
                        cis-acting RNA elements that ensure the specific replication of viral RNA by a 
                        virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The embedded cis-acting elements 
                        devoted to coronavirus replication constitute a small fraction of the total genome, 
                        but this is presumed to be a reflection of the fact that coronaviruses have the largest 
                        genomes of all RNA viruses.</p>

                <div class="col col-1 col-bg">
                    <p>The assembly of infectious coronavirus particles requires the selection of viral genomic
                         RNA from a cellular pool that contains an abundant excess of non-viral and viral RNAs. 
                         Among the seven to ten specific viral mRNAs synthesized in virus-infected cells, only 
                         the full-length genomic RNA is packaged efficiently into coronavirus particles. 
                         Studies have revealed cis-acting elements and trans-acting viral factors involved in 
                         the coronavirus genome encapsidation and packaging.</p>
